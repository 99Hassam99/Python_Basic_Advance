from module import Func


# ‘__name__’ evaluates to the name of the module in python from where the program is
# run.
# If the module is being run directly from the command line, the ‘ __name__’ is set to
# string “__main__”. Thus, this behaviour is used to check whether the module is run
# directly or imported to another file
